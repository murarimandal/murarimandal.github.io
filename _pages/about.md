I am an Asst. Professor at the School of Computer Engineering, KIIT Bhubaneshwar. I lead the RespAI Lab where we focus on advancing large language models (LLMs) by addressing challenges related to long-content processing, inference efficiency, interpretability, and alignment. Our research also explores synthetic persona creation, regulatory issues, and innovative methods for model merging, knowledge verification, and unlearning. My research work has been published in ICML, KDD, AAAI, ACM MM, CVPR. Check out my research group's website here: <a href="https://respailab.github.io" target="_blank">RespAI Lab</a>. I regularly serve as a Reviewer to NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, CVPR, ICCV, and ECCV. Indexed in <a href="https://csrankings.org/#/index?all&in" target="_blank">CSRankings</a>. I am also part of the <a href="https://www.brainxai.com/brainx-consultants" target="_blank">BrainX AI</a> research community actively working on AI in Healthcare research!

<b>Research Impact:</b> My pioneering works had significant impact in the field of Machine Unlearning with follow up works by <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.08827v1" target="_blank">Anthropic</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15268" target="_blank">Yoshua Bengio</a>, <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/062d711fb777322e2152435459e6e9d9-Abstract-Conference.html" target="_blank">Google Deepmind</a>, etc. With 600+ citations, our works <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.08947" target="_blank">Fast Unlearning</a> [TNNLS], <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05629" target="_blank">Zero shot Unlearning</a> [TIFS], and <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/25879/25651" target="_blank">Bad Teacher</a> [AAAI] are among top 10 highly cited papers in the field of Machine Unlearning. 

Earlier, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at National University of Singapore (NUS). I worked with <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~mohan/" target="_blank">Prof. Mohan Kankanhalli</a> in the School of Computing. Long time back, I graduated in 2011 with a Bachelors in Computer Science from BITS, Pilani. Find me on X @murari_ai.
