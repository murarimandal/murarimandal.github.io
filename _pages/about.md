I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Computer Engineering, KIIT Bhubaneshwar. I lead the RespAI Lab where we work on the topics related to responsible AI, machine unlearning, data valuation, ethical use of large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models. My research work has been published in ICML, KDD, AAAI, ACM MM, CVPR. Check out my research group's website here: <a href="https://respailab.github.io" target="_blank">RespAI Lab</a>. I regularly serve as a Reviewer to NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, CVPR, ICCV, and ECCV. Indexed in <a href="https://csrankings.org/#/index?all&in" target="_blank">CSRankings</a>. 

<b>Research Impact:</b> My pioneering work on Machine Unlearning is cited by research at <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.08827v1" target="_blank">Anthropic</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15268" target="_blank">Yoshua Bengio, Hugo Larochelle</a>, <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/062d711fb777322e2152435459e6e9d9-Abstract-Conference.html" target="_blank">Google Deepmind</a>, <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/29092" target="_blank">University of Cambridge</a>, etc. Our works <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.08947" target="_blank">fastunlearn</a> [TNNLS], <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05629" target="_blank">zeroshotunlearn</a> [TIFS], and <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/25879/25651" target="_blank">badteacher</a> [AAAI] are among top 10 highly cited papers in the field of Machine Unlearning. 

Earlier, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at National University of Singapore (NUS). I worked with <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~mohan/" target="_blank">Prof. Mohan Kankanhalli</a> in the School of Computing. Long time back, I graduated in 2011 with a Bachelors in Computer Science from BITS, Pilani.
