I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Computer Engineering, KiiT Bhubaneshwar. I lead the RespAI Lab research group where we work on the topics related to responsible AI, machine unlearning, data valuation, ethical use of large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models. Check out the website here: <a href="https://respailab.github.io" target="_blank">RespAI Lab</a>

I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at National University of Singapore (NUS). I worked with <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~mohan/" target="_blank">Prof. Mohan Kankanhalli</a> and <a href="https://www.jussikeppo.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Jussi Keppo</a> in the <a href="https://ncript.comp.nus.edu.sg/" target="_blank">N-CRiPT Lab</a>.

My current research is in Responsible AI, Machine Unlearning, Data Valuation, Synthetic Data Generation, and Federated Learning. I earier research include video surveillance (moving object detection, anomaly detection), human emotion analysis, aerial surveillance (UAV-based visual data analytics), visual quality enhancement (haze removal, night-image enhancement, image inpainting).
