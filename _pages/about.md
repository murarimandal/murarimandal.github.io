I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Computer Engineering, KIIT Bhubaneshwar. I lead the RespAI Lab where we work on the topics related to responsible AI, machine unlearning, data valuation, ethical use of large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models. My research work has been published in ICML, KDD, AAAI, ACM MM, CVPR. Check out my research group's website here: <a href="https://respailab.github.io" target="_blank">RespAI Lab</a>
