I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Computer Engineering, KIIT Bhubaneshwar. I lead the RespAI Lab where we work on the topics related to machine unlearning, alignment in LLMs and diffusion models, reasoning and AI safety. My research work has been published in ICML, KDD, AAAI, ACM MM, CVPR. Check out my research group's website here: <a href="https://respailab.github.io" target="_blank">RespAI Lab</a>. I regularly serve as a Reviewer to NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, CVPR, ICCV, and ECCV. Indexed in <a href="https://csrankings.org/#/index?all&in" target="_blank">CSRankings</a>. 

<b>Research Impact:</b> My pioneering works on Machine Unlearning is cited by <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.08827v1" target="_blank">Anthropic</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15268" target="_blank">Yoshua Bengio, Hugo Larochelle</a>, <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/062d711fb777322e2152435459e6e9d9-Abstract-Conference.html" target="_blank">Google Deepmind</a>, etc. With 500+ citations, our works <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.08947" target="_blank">Fast Unlearning</a> [TNNLS], <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05629" target="_blank">Zero shot Unlearning</a> [TIFS], and <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/25879/25651" target="_blank">Bad Teacher</a> [AAAI] are among top 10 highly cited papers in the field of Machine Unlearning. 

Earlier, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at National University of Singapore (NUS). I worked with <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~mohan/" target="_blank">Prof. Mohan Kankanhalli</a> in the School of Computing. Long time back, I graduated in 2011 with a Bachelors in Computer Science from BITS, Pilani. Find me on X @murari_ai.

## <b>Current Research</b>
- Addressing Challenges in Long-Content Processing for LLMs: Investigating solutions to performance bottlenecks, memory limitations, latency issues, and information loss when dealing with extended content lengths in large language models (LLMs).
  
- Optimizing LLM Inference Efficiency: Developing strategies to reduce the computational cost of LLM inference, focusing on improving speed, memory usage, and leveraging smaller models for complex tasks.

- Interpretability and Alignment of Generative AI Models: Exploring the interpretability of generative AI models, aligning their outputs with human values, and addressing the issue of hallucinations in model responses.

- Synthetic Persona and Society Creation: Creating and studying synthetic personalities, communities, and societies within LLMs, and analyzing the behaviors and dynamics of these synthetic constructs.

- Regulatory Challenges in LLMs: Investigating regulatory concerns surrounding LLMs, including the implementation of unlearning techniques to comply with data privacy regulations and enhance model fairness.

- Model Merging and Knowledge Verification: Developing methods for merging multiple models, editing model behavior, and verifying the accuracy and consistency of the knowledge they generate.
